    <synopsis>Led by Billy Janitsch '15. APIs allow you to programmatically access data from websites in a useful form. Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, Google Maps, Freebase, Wikipedia, last.fm, Digg, and even CS50 all have APIs that you can use to work with a variety of interesting data. Have another source in mind? There's probably an APP for that. Oops, I mean an API. All familiarity levels welcome, and those in search of ideas for a cool final project are particularly encouraged to attend.</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Led by Jordan Jozwiak '14. As of September 2012, Android had a 68% market share on smart phones (iOS trailed with only 17% share). Android has matured substantially in the last few years and is undoubtedly here to stay. What are the differences between iOS and Android? How has Android changed with the release of ICS and Jelly Bean? And, most importantly, how can you get started developing for Android using Java and Eclipse?</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Led by Chris Wysopal. Risks to mobile devices are similar to those of traditional software applications and a result of insecure coding practices, privacy violating design, and malicious intent. But mobile devices aren't just small computers: they are designed around personal and communication functionality. This makes the top mobile applications risks different from the top traditional computing risks - and an easier opportunity for those with malicious intent. This presentation will discuss the threat landscape and how developers and enterprise IT can tackle mobile app risk.</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Led by Kevin Schmid '15. JavaScript! It's awesome when you want to add interactive, client-side features to a website. But coding large projects in JavaScript can be difficult: it's tough to keep track of events, and maintain organization of the code! Enter in JavaScript frameworks, which are useful in solving these kinds of issues. In this seminar, we'll dive into the details and aspects of some frameworks, and discuss what kind of design challenges they address. Some knowledge of JavaScript, such as events and objects, is ideal, but not necessary.</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Led by Brandon Liu '14. Web frameworks are absolutely essential for making websites: They organize your code so that it's more maintainable, and they take care of common problems like user input sanitation and data model validation so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time. There are dozens of web frameworks out there, but Kohana is one of the easiest to learn, while still providing plenty of features. It's written in PHP, so there's no need to learn a new language! The seminar will be a live-coding session, building a blog from the ground up using Kohana. Students are free to code along, but I will be moving quickly to cover more ground.</synopsis>

Pattern matching is useful when analyzing user input on consumer websites, cleaning experimental data, or mining source texts for statistical information. This seminar gives students conceptual strategies for converting patterns into regular expressions; practice using the Python re library to solve puzzles; and background to use the many implementations of regular expressions in command-line tools and languages including Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, C#, PHP, and MYSQL.</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Led by Esmond Kane. This seminar will be a truncated version of the National Cyber Security Awareness Month presentations available here: http://hvrd.me/Rx1Se9 During this year, a record number of popular online service providers, ranging from email, to social media, to cloud file sharing, were compromised resulting in our data being exposed. Now, more than ever, we need to be mindful of the need for constant vigilance when it comes to computer security. To protect yourself from cyber risks, here are some things you can do: 1. Ensure your computer has been set to automatically update 2. Enable your computer's operating system firewall 3. Install antivirus software and ensure it is set to automatically update 4. Install HTTPS and anti-tracking extensions 5. Only save your passwords to a password safe, never save passwords to your browser 6. Select a unique password for each of your accounts, do not use a common password for all of your accounts 7. Use two-factor authentication for accounts that offer it, for example, Google, PayPal, Dropbox, Facebook and many others offer free or low cost two-factor authentication 8. Be suspicious of opening email you were not expecting, or from someone you do not know, and never reply to an email asking for your password 9. Consider encrypting your hard disk using your computer's operating system encryption program, for example, FileVault or BitLocker 10. Back up your hard disk; make a local backup AND make an online backup of important data.</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Led by Douglas Kline. Unix shells consist of and depend on environments and other provisions that differ from those of other operating systems. Unix offers several different shells which have some things in common with each other. One, bash, is now becoming available on other operating systems and may become shell-lingua franca. Understanding the bases of the shells, their various capabilities, and how they differ from each other can greatly increase one's capabilities of using Unix and also illustrate the history and development of the shells and the operating system in general. Understanding how they differ from shells of other operating systems can promote understanding of both and forestall confusion and mistakes. I intend this primarily as a practical seminar as the topic isn't really theoretical and the broader historical implications have more to do with the irregular, idiosyncratic origins of Unix rather than principles of computer science.</synopsis>

    <synopsis>Led by Brandon Liu '14. Vim is one of the most popular text editors used by programmers. It is generally agreed that Vim allows for faster text editing than any other application, but there is a misconception that Vim has a extremely steep learning curve. With the proper instruction and guidance, you'll find yourself coding in Vim in no time, faster than ever before! This seminar will start with a showcase of what Vim is capable of, and then break out into a hands-on workshop where everyone gets their hands dirty with some Vim practice!</synopsis>
