    <synopsis>Led by Jeff Solnet '12 and Punit Shah '12. This seminar will cover the basics of developing SMS-based mobile applications. We will discuss and demonstrate how to use the Zeep Mobile and TextMarks Lite APIs, in conjunction with PHP scripts, to develop interactive SMS applications. SMS (i.e. text messages) is a nearly-universal technology on cell phones. It allows developers to create mobile applications that are cheap and compatible with all phones, whether you're using a smartphone (iPhone, Blackberry, G1) or your parents' old black-and-white Nokia. If you're thinking about changing the world, SMS has been a useful platform for the developing world where few serviced populations have access to advanced mobile devices. Farmers in many African countries are now able to get up-to-date pricing and other agricultural data thanks to SMS applications. In Kenya, mobile (SMS) banking is rapidly changing the way Kenyans create and conduct business. Whether you're interested in updating Shuttleboy or solving world peace, this seminar will be a good starting point.</synopsis>
